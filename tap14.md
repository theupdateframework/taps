# Abstract

The TUF specification does not currently support changes
that are not backwards compatible. If a repository and a client are not using
the same version of the TUF specification, differences in metadata format may
mean that metadata cannot be safely and reliably verified. Any changes to the specification that
affect the metadata in this way are considered breaking changes. This TAP
addresses this clash of versions by allowing TUF
implementations to independently manage updates on clients and repositories.
This in turn ensures that TUF will continue functioning after breaking changes
are implemented.

To allow TUF implementers to adopt breaking changes without an interruption to
providing and verifying updates, this TAP requires two
changes: one to the way the TUF specification manages versions, and the other to
how TUF implementations perform updates. The former is accomplished by having this TAP require
that the specification use Semantic Versioning to separate breaking from
non-breaking changes. The latter is achieved by allowing both clients and
repositories to maintain sets of TUF metadata that follow different versions of the TUF specification
so that reliable updates can continue throughout the process of the specification
upgrade. To do so, repositories can generate metadata for multiple TUF
specification versions and maintain them in an accessible directory. In
addition, clients can include support for metadata from previous TUF versions.
To determine the version to use for an update, clients will select the most
recent specification version supported by both the client and the repository.


# Motivation

Various TAPs, including TAPs 3 and 8, propose breaking changes.
Because these changes are not compatible with previous TUF versions,
current implementations that use the existing specification cannot access the
new features in these TAPs. By creating a way to deal with
breaking changes, TUF will be able to continuously provide secure
updates when breaking changes are made to the repository or
client. The use cases addressed in this TAP are listed below.

## Use case 1: A repository updates to a new TUF specification version

As new features become available in the TUF specification, repositories may wish
to upgrade to a new version. This could include adding TAPs with breaking
changes. When the repository upgrades, clients that use an older version of the
TUF specification will no longer be able to provide the security properties of TUF when
parsing metadata from the repository as the fields in the metadata may have changed.
However, repositories and clients may be managed by different people with
different interests who may not be able to coordinate the upgrade to a new TUF version.
To resolve this problem, clients will first need a way to determine whether
their version of TUF specification is compatible with the version used by the repository.
This is to ensure that clients always parse metadata according to the TUF version
that generated that metadata. Then, they will need some way to process updates
after this upgrade occurs on the repository to ensure reliable access to
updates, even if they are not able to upgrade immediately due to development
time or other constraints.

## Use case 2: A client updates to a new TUF specification version

Just as a repository may be upgraded, a TUF client may wish to upgrade to a new
TUF specification version to use new features. When the client implements an upgrade that
includes a breaking change, it cannot be sure that all repositories have also
upgraded to the new specification version. Therefore, after the client upgrades
they must ensure that any metadata downloaded from a repository is parsed using
a compatible TUF version. If the repository is using an older version, the client
should have some way to allow the update to proceed.

## Use case 3: A delegated targets role uses a different TUF specification version than the repository

A delegated role may make and sign metadata using a different version of the TUF
specification than the repository hosting the top-level roles. Delegated roles
and the top-level repository may be managed by people in different organizations
who are not able to coordinate upgrading to a new version of the TUF
specification. In this case, a client should be able to parse delegations that
generate metadata with a different TUF specification version than the repository.

## Use case 4: A client downloads metadata from multiple repositories

As described in TAP 4, TUF clients may download metadata from multiple
repositories. These repositories may not coordinate with each other, and so may
not upgrade to a new TUF specification version at the same time. A client should
be able to use multiple repositories that do not use the same version of TUF.
For example, a client may download metadata from one repository that uses TUF
version 1.0.0 and another repository that uses version 2.0.0.

## Use case 5: Backwards compatibility for existing clients

Existing TUF clients (written before this TAP is implemented) will still expect
to download and parse metadata. Before this TAP there was no method for determining compatibility
between a client and a repository, so existing TUF repositories should continue
to distribute metadata using their existing method to support existing clients. This
means that this mechanism for allowing backwards compatible updates must itself
be backwards compatible.

# Rationale

We propose this TAP because as TUF continues to evolve, the need for TUF clients
and repositories to upgrade their TUF metadata format will grow. This sets up the potential for clients
that are no longer able to perform updates because they cannot parse the
metadata generated by repositories, or for clients to install the wrong target files
due to changes in TUF. Both of these issues prevent clients from installing the
targets intended by repository managers, and in extreme cases could lead to critical security or
functionality problems. TUF clients and repositories need to be able to upgrade
to new versions without preventing secure and reliable access to software
updates.

In trying to create more flexible functionality between servers and clients when
it comes to dealing with different versions of the TUF specification, we identified two main
issues that need to be addressed. First, clients need to be able to determine
whether the TUF specification version they implement is compatible with the TUF
specification version of the metadata they receive. This ensures that clients parse
metadata according to the correct version to prevent errors from any changes to
the metadata in the new version. Second, clients need a way to use this
information to determine how to access metadata that is compatible with the
version of the TUF specification they implement.

To address the first issue, this TAP proposes standardizing the specification
version field to separate breaking changes from non-breaking changes and
ensure that the field can be compared across TUF clients and repositories.
Separating out non-breaking changes allows these backwards compatible changes to
happen at any time without affecting TUF's operation. Therefore, clients and
repositories can still coordinate after a non-breaking change occurs. One common
framework used to separate versions by type is Semantic Versioning. Semantic
Versioning is a versioning scheme popular across open source projects that
categorizes project versions by the scope and criticality of their
changes. Breaking changes in the specification would warrant a MAJOR version
number increase, while non-breaking changes would warrant only a MINOR version
number increase. In addition, Semantic Versioning has a standard way to format
version numbers so that they can be parsed and compared across implementations.

To address the second issue of accessing a compatible version, there are three
possible approaches. First, each repository could maintain sets of metadata that
implement multiple TUF versions while the clients only implement one TUF
specification version. In this case, TUF clients could not use metadata from
multiple repositories unless they all generate metadata that supports the same
TUF version (Use Case 4). In the second approach, each client could maintain
multiple versions that implement different versions of the TUF specification
while the repositories each generate metadata following a single TUF
specification version. In this case, if a repository upgrades to support a new
TUF version, clients will be unable to perform updates until support for the new
version is added to the client (Use Case 1). The third option is to implement
support for multiple TUF versions on both clients and repositories. This option
allows clients and repositories to be upgraded to support new versions of the
TUF specification independently and supports all use cases mentioned in this TAP.

This TAP adopts the third option, and describes procedures for both clients and
repositories to implement multiple TUF specification versions at the same time.
This requires both clients and
repositories to maintain multiple versions of the TUF spec, as well as changes
to the way repositories store metadata and clients parse this metadata.

For repositories, this means continuing support for old TUF versions for some
period of time after upgrading. This grace period gives existing clients that
implement old versions of the TUF specification time to implement support for a
new specification version. Repositories achieve this using a directory structure
with a directory for each supported TUF specification version. These directories
contain metadata that supports the given TUF specification version. Using these
directories, a client is able to choose the most recent metadata they support.
More details about this directory structure are contained in the [specification](#how-a-repository-updates).
This TAP will also add a `supported_versions` field to root metadata so that the client
can discover the supported specification versions on the repository.

On the client side, this TAP also requires maintenance of multiple versions that
support different major TUF specification
versions to allow for communication with various repositories. To do so, it is
recommended that clients maintain functions that can be used to validate
metadata from previous major TUF specification versions. These functions allow a
client to maintain old versions of the specification while still supporting the
most recent version.

The top-level TUF metadata (root, snapshot, timestamp, and top-level targets)
used to install an update should all implement the same TUF specification
version. A specification change may rely on more than one metadata file (for
example a change in the signing process would affect all metadata types), so
using the same specification version for top-level metadata allows for these
large changes to the specification. For information about how this relates to
targets metadata pinning and TAP 13, see [Special Cases](#tap-13). However,
delegated targets metadata might not be
managed by the same parties as the top-level metadata. For this reason, this TAP
allows clients to use a different TUF specification version for delegated
targets by maintaining functions to parse metadata that conforms to different
specification versions. This compromise allows TUF specification changes to affect multiple
metadata files while allowing flexibility in how repositories and delegations
are managed.

For example, during the course of an update a client could use `4.0.0_parse_root`,
`4.0.0_parse_snapshot`, `4.0.0_parse_timestamp`, `4.0.0_parse_targets`,
`4.0.0_parse_delegation`, and `3.0.0_parse_delegation`.


# Specification

As stated above, this TAP defines a variety of procedures to be added to the
update process on both clients and repositories. These changes include the way in which
version numbers are determined, the addition of new directories on repositories
and new metadata parsing functions on clients, and a new process for finding
compatible metadata.

For clarity, throughout this TAP *upgrading* refers to the process of moving
from one TUF specification version to another while *updating* refers to the
process of downloading and validating packages as specified by TUF. The rest of
this section details the changes to the TUF specification recommended by this
TAP.


## Version Number Format

Using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), breaking changes will only
occur during a major release of the TUF specification (e.g. 1.x.x to 2.x.x). The
'spec_version' field of root metadata will follow this convention, with version
numbers in the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. This is a standard format used in other
open source projects that makes the meaning of a TUF version number change
consistent and easily understood. The Backwards Compatibility section of a TAP
should be used to determine whether the TAP creates a breaking change. If the
change is not backwards compatible, such as those in TAPs 3 and 8, then it will
be part of a new major version of the TUF specification. Non backwards
compatible versions add features that change the way that TUF processes updates
and so clients and repositories need to use code that supports the same major
version when performing an update in order to maintain security and functionality.

If the change adds a new feature that is backwards compatible, for example in
TAP 4, it should be part of a new minor version. These TAPs add
additional features to TUF, but clients that do not have these features will
still be able to securely and reliably perform updates from repositories that
support the TAPs. There may be minor differences as to which updates a client
installs across minor versions. If a repository maintainer is worried about the
impact of a minor change on clients, it may choose to wait to implement the
change with a major specification version (for example, they could remain on
version 2.4.6 after the release of 2.5). Patches are used to fix typos and make
small changes to existing features. More details about what constitutes a major,
minor, or patch change can be found at https://semver.org/.

### Changes to TAPs

In order to manage changes to TUF, TAPs shall be tied to a version of the TUF
specification.

Once a TAP is accepted, a TUF Version field in the header should list the first
TUF version that will include the TAP. The Preamble Header description in TAP 1
has been updated to include the TUF Version field.


## How a repository updates

Repositories will add two things. They MUST put metadata for new TUF
specification versions in new
directories. In addition, root metadata on a repository MUST add a `supported_versions` field
to indicate which specification versions are supported.

As described in the [Rationale](#rationale), repositories should support multiple
TUF specification versions. In order to do so, this TAP proposes a new directory
structure for repositories. When a repository manager chooses to upgrade to a
new major TUF specification version, they create a new directory on the repository named
for the major version (for example 2). This directory will contain all
metadata files for the new specification version, but target files will remain in the
parent directory to save space. In this case the metadata files (in directories according to their spec
version) can point to target files relative to the parent directory. After creating
the directory, the repository creates and signs root, snapshot, timestamp, and
top-level targets metadata using the new TUF specification version and places these
metadata files in the directory. The root file should be signed by both the new
root key and the current root key (the root key from the most recent metadata in
the previous major specification version). The new supported version number, and information about the new root metadata will then be added to `supported-versions` in all previously supported specification versions. Clients will now be able to use the new
metadata files once their TUF specification versions are also updated. After an update to
version 2.0.0, the repository structure may look like:


```
- Target files
- 1
  |- metadata files
- 2
  |- metadata files
```

Repository updates to a new minor or patch specification version shall be done
by uploading new metadata files in the new format to the proper directory. So if
a repository updates from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0, the 2.1.0 metadata would go in the
directory named 2. Minor and patch version changes are backwards compatible,
so clients using version 2.0.0 will still be able to parse metadata written
using version 2.1.0.

A repository may continue to support old major TUF specification versions by creating
metadata in both the old location and the new directory. A repository manager
may maintain as many versions as desired, though any version with security
concerns should be phased out as soon as possible. This can be done by stopping
the creation of new metadata files in the directory for the phased out version.
In order to allow clients to parse the root metadata chain, root metadata files
shall not be deleted even once a version is deprecated.

A repository may indicate the planned phase out of metadata conforming to a
major version of the TUF specification using an optional `becomes_obsolete`
field in root and targets metadata. This field can be added to root and targets
metadata once a date is set for deprecation of metadata adhering to a
TUF specification version by the repository and will include the timestamp after
which the metadata for the current specification version will no longer be
maintained. Inclusion of this field will signal to clients both that they will
need to upgrade to the next specification version before the timestamp, and
that there will not be metadata available in the current directory after this
point. The client can check the `becomes_obsolete` field in root metadata
before checking the metadata expiration. This allows them to differentiate between metadata
that is expired due to intended deprecation, and metadata that is expired, e.g. because
an attacker blocked the update. Delegated targets may include this field independent of
top-level metadata to indicate when the metadata they are responsible for will
no longer support a given TUF specification version. With the addition of this
field, the "signed" portion of targets metadata will include the following:

```
{ "_type" : "targets",
  "spec_version" : SPEC_VERSION,
  ("becomes_obsolete": BECOMES_OBSOLETE),
  "version" : VERSION,
  "expires" : EXPIRES,
  "targets" : TARGETS,
  ("delegations" : DELEGATIONS)
}
```

And the "signed" portion of root will include:

```
{ "_type" : "root",
  "spec_version" : SPEC_VERSION,
  ("becomes_obsolete": BECOMES_OBSOLETE),
  "consistent_snapshot": CONSISTENT_SNAPSHOT,
  "version" : VERSION,
  "expires" : EXPIRES,
  "keys" : {
      KEYID : KEY
      , ... },
  "roles" : {
      ROLE : {
        "keyids" : [ KEYID, ... ] ,
        "threshold" : THRESHOLD }
      , ... }
}
```

where `BECOMES_OBSOLETE` is a timestamp.

For existing TUF clients to continue operation after this TAP is implemented,
repositories may store metadata from before TUF 2.0.0 in the top-level
repository (with no directory named 1). This allows existing clients to
continue downloading metadata from the repository. So a TUF repository that
upgrades from version 1.x.y to version 2.0.0 may look like:


```
- Targets files
- 1.x.y metadata files
- 2
  |- 2.x.y metadata files
```

In order to fascilitate the upgrade to a new specification version, root metadata for all supported spec versions MUST add a `supported_versions` field before upgrading to spec version 2.0.0.
This field will serve two purpose.


First, not all TUF repositories have a mechanism that is able to list all directories
in a folder (the equivalent of the `ls` command). For these repositories (such
as OCI registries or http servers), as well as to prevent specification version
freeze attacks, the `supported_versions` field will lists
all versions supported by the repository to allow for client discovery.

Second, the root metadata format or versioning scheme may change between major specification versions.
The `supported_versions` field will contain the filename and a secure hash of the first root metadata file that should be used in the new specification version.

As it is
included in root metadata, the contents of `supported_versions` will be signed by a threshold of root keys, securing against a specification version rollback, and signing the new trusted root metadata.
This field will contain the following:

```
{ ...,
  "supported_versions" : [
    { "version": MAJOR_VERSION,
      "path": FOLDER_NAME,
      "root-filename": ROOT_FILENAME,
      "root-digest": ROOT_DIGEST
      },
    ...
  ]
}

```

where `MAJOR_VERSION` is the integer representing a supported major version
and `FOLDER_NAME` is the string representing the folder containing metadata for
this supported major version (e.g. { "version": 2, "path": "2" }).
`FOLDER_NAME` MUST NOT contain any subdirectories.
In most cases, `MAJOR_VERSION` should match `FOLDER_NAME`.
For backwards compatability, version 1 should be assumed to be in the top-level
repository with no directory named 1. `ROOT_FILENAME` is the name of the root metadata file in the new specification version. `ROOT_DIGEST` is the digest of the new root metadata file.

A repository should generate all TUF metadata, including root metadata, for all
TUF versions that the repository supports. Any update to TUF targets or delegations should be reflected across
all of these versions.

## Changes to TUF clients

TUF clients must store the TUF specification versions they support and may add
functions to maintain old versions. In order to find compatible updates on a
repository, a client must keep track of the TUF specification versions it
supports. To do so, local storage on the client should contain the client
specification version, or specification version range. For simplicity, this
field should be formatted according to Semantic Versioning so that it can be
directly compared to the specification version in root metadata.

There may be multiple versions of the specification supported by each TUF
client. This allows metadata downloads from a repository or delegated role that
does not support the current specification. To allow for this behavior, when a
new version of the TUF client is implemented, it may contain the ability to call
certain functions from the old client for parsing and validating metadata.
Should the client choose to make an old specification version obsolete, it can
remove the functions for that version. However, it does risk being unable to
download new targets from delegations that use the old specification version.
TUF implementers should decide how many old specification versions to support
based on the expected usage of their implementation.

Additionally, TUF clients should keep track of the last used specification
version for each repository they connect to. They should use this version
number to ensure that the repository or an attacker on the network does not
remove the higher version and force the client to use a lower versioned,
potentially less secure specification version.


### Changes to the update process

When a TUF client downloads metadata from a repository, the client must
determine which specification version to use for the download. To do this,
the client looks for the highest supported version on the repository using the
following procedure:

* The client determines the latest version available on the repository by
parsing the `supported_versions` field in the currently trusted root metadata.
* The client determines the specification version to use using the following:
	* If the latest version on the repository is lower than the previous
specification version the client used from this repository, the client
should report an error and terminate the update.
	* If the latest version on the repository is equal to that of the client, it
will use this version to download metadata.
	* If the latest version pre-dates the client specification version, it may call functions
from a previous client version to download the metadata. The client may support
as many or as few versions as desired for the application. If the previous
version is not available, the client shall report that an update can not be
performed due to an old specification version on the repository.
	* If the latest version on the repository is higher than the client spec
version, the client should report to the user that it is not using the most up
to date version, and then perform the update with the directory that corresponds with the latest
client specification version, if available. If no such directory exists, the client
terminates the update.
* If the client will be using a higher specification version than on their previous update, they will update their trusted root metadata by downloading the metadata available in the new specification version's directory at the root metadata location specified in the currently trusted root metadata. The client will verify that the hash of this file matches the digest listed in the current root metadata. If so, the client will set their trusted root metadata to the downloaded file.

Once the supported directory is determined and root metadata is updated, the client shall attempt the update
using the metadata in this directory. Every time the trusted root metadata
file is updated, the client should perform this check to determine the specification version to use going forward.

For example, if a client has a specification version of 3.5 and a repository has
directories for 2, 3, and 4, the client will report that spec
version 4.x is available, then download metadata from the 3 directory. This reporting is
up to the discretion of each application, but it should be used to encourage
updating the client to the most recent specification version.

Alternatively, if the same client downloads metadata from a repository with
directories 1 and 2, the client could download metadata from 2 using
a 2.x version of the client. If 2.x is not supported by the client, the client
will report that it is unable to perform an update.

When a client validates root and targets metadata, they may check for the
`becomes_obsolete` field. If this field is present, the client should do
the following:
* If the current time is after the time listed in `becomes_obsolete`, the
client should report to the user that the update is not available due to a
version mismatch and consider the current metadata file invalid. If
this is the root or top-level targets file, the update should be terminated.
* Otherwise, the client should warn the user that the TUF specification version
they are using will be deprecated at the time indicated by `becomes_obsolete`
and proceed with the update.

## Special Cases

### Multiple Repositories

A TUF client that performs updates using multiple repositories may need to
access repositories that use different specification versions. When comparing
metadata from multiple repositories, the goal is to ensure that the downloaded
target file is verified by all repositories. Therefore the client can perform
validation for each repository independently, and then compare the results.

To do so, the client needs to ensure that the metadata from each repository is
valid for the given targets file. If the repositories use different versions of
the TUF specification, the client should use the version that corresponds to
each repository to validate its metadata. Results from all repositories could
then be compared. The update will only be considered valid if valid metadata
from both repositories point to the same target file, and it matches the hashes
provided by each repository. Note that different TUF versions may use different
hashing algorithms. If this is the case, both hashes should be verified
independently.

### TAP 13

A TUF client that supports TAP 13 may download targets metadata that were
uploaded by different parties.
However, breaking changes may require that all top-level metadata
files use the same TUF specification version. To manage this, a client
configuration file that lists a custom top-level targets metadata file
as described in TAP 13 should only include targets metadata files using the
same TUF specification version as the root metadata file.

The owner of the client configuration is responsible for ensuring that any
custom targets metadata files use the same TUF specification version as the root
metadata. If the repository that contains the root metadata supports multiple
TUF specification versions, the client configuration should list a targets metadata
file that is available in all supported specification versions.

Clients should verify that all top-level metadata use the same TUF specification
version as the root metadata. If a metadata file provided by the TAP 13 configuration
does not meet this criteria, it will be considered invalid and the client should
terminate the update.

### Delegations

The TUF specification version(s) supported by a delegation does not need to
match the version(s) supported by the top-level metadata. A delegation may use
the directory structure described above to indicate which major TUF specification
versions it supports. The TUF client is responsible for parsing the metadata
from delegations using code that implements the appropriate major specification
version (found using the same procedure as described in
[Changes to the update process](#changes-to-the-update-process)). If there is no
compatible specification version between the client and delegation, the client
should report this and terminate the update.


# Security Analysis

Overall, this TAP will increase the security of TUF systems by allowing for
faster upgrades to TUF clients and repositories. However, there are a few
attacks and changes to the security model that should be discussed.

## Downgrade Attack
A downgrade attack on the TUF specification version may be possible if an
attacker is able to block access to a directory on the repository. This would
mean that a client would use metadata from a previous specification version when
performing an update.
However, a client would be able to detect this attack using the `supported_versions`
field listed in root metadata and signed with root keys.

Clients that have previously used a repository will store the specification
version used to communicate with that repository, so a downgrade attack will
be limited by the previous specification version used by the client. So, if
the client previously updated from repository A using version 2.1.0, they would
only accept future updates using specification version 2.1.0 or a later from
repository A.

In addition, to mitigate the damage from a downgrade attack in case a
security flaw is found in a version of the TUF specification, the vulnerable
version should no longer be supported on the repository (the metadata files
should be revoked or allowed to expire). In addition, clients should be upgraded
to no longer support a vulnerable specification version.

## Root Key Rotation
The TUF version upgrade system described in this TAP uses the previous trusted root metadata to sign the root metadata in future specification versions. The first time
a new TUF version is used by the client, it checks the new root metadata against the hash listed in the root metadata of the previously used specification version. If the root metadata is not signed by the
previous trusted root key, the update does not proceed, and the client halts the
update. In this way, updates to the repository's TUF version do not impact the
security of an update.

## How a client upgrades
When a client upgrades itself to a new TUF version, it should use TUF for the
self update to ensure that it downloads a valid new client. To do so, it should
use its current TUF version to upgrade to the new version of TUF. For example,
if a client running TUF version 2.5.0 wants to upgrade to version 3.0.0, the
client should use metadata from TUF version 2.x.x to self update. Using this
technique, the TUF client can ensure that it downloads the intended update when
upgrading to a new version.

## Other considerations
As always, authors of TUF clients should ensure that the client is a valid
implementation of TUF and that no security flaws are introduced in code.
In addition, supply chain security techniques (for example [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/in-toto.html))
should be used to ensure that vulnerabilities are not introduced into TUF
clients between when they are written and installed.

Note that an attacker on the same network could inject false metadata to block a
client from updating. However, this denial of service attack is always possible
for an attacker on the network with the ability to alter network traffic.

# Backwards Compatibility

This TAP is backwards compatible and should be implemented on all repositories
before any non-backwards compatible TAPs are released.

Existing TUF implementations should continue to store TUF 1.0.0 metadata
using their existing method to maintain backwards compatibility as described
in the specification section.

# Augmented Reference Implementation

Semantic Versioning was added to the TUF Reference Implementation in [#914](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/pull/914).
The rest of this proposal has not yet been implemented.
